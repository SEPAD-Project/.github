## What is SAP?
SAP (Student Attention Platform) is a powerful tool designed to help schools enhance their online classrooms by providing real-time feedback on student engagement and attention.

## What does SAP do?
SAP monitors student attention by analyzing facial expressions and collecting detailed data from the student’s face. It also tracks the student's desktop and open applications to ensure they are staying focused during class. This data is sent to the teacher for real-time monitoring.

## How SAP Works
Here’s how SAP operates:
1. **Registration:** Schools, classes, teachers, and students must be fully registered in the system.
2. **Student App:** Students use their special app to generate feedback. The app collects data from the student's face and desktop to generate useful feedback.
3. **Teacher App:** The feedback is sent to the teacher, who can view it in real-time on their dedicated app.

## How to use SAP
To use SAP, schools must sign up for an account and select a personalized plan. Once registered, schools can add classes, teachers, and students to the system.
