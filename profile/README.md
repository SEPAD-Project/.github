## What is SEPAD?
SEPAD is a software suite designed to assist schools in evaluating students' attentiveness during online classes, while also enhancing their focus and engagement in virtual sessions.

## What does SEPAD do?
SEPAD monitors student engagement in real time by analyzing facial expressions and tracking desktop activity, including open applications. This data helps teachers identify distractions and ensure students remain focused during online classes.

## How SEPAD Works
Here’s how SEPAD operates:
1. **Registration:** Schools, classes, teachers, and students must be fully registered in the system.
2. **Student App:** Students utilize this application to monitor and submit their engagement levels during online classes. The system employs facial recognition to analyze attentiveness, evaluates responsiveness to notifications, and monitors desktop activity. All collected data is processed and transmitted to the server for comprehensive evaluation.
3. **Teacher App:** Using this system, teachers can monitor the approximate attention levels of students who joined the class, displayed as percentage values in a dedicated dashboard.

## How to use SEPAD
To use SEPAD, schools must sign up for an account and select a personalized plan. Once registered, schools can add classes, teachers, and students to the system.
